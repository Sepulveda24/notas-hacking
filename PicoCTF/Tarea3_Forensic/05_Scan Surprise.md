Hints:
1.‚Å† ‚Å†QR codes are a way of encoding data. While they're most known for storing URLs, they can store other things too.
2.Mobile phones have included native QR code scanners in their cameras since version 8 (Oreo) and iOS 11
3.If you don't have access to a phone, you can also use zbar-tools to convert an image to text
